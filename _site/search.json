    "text": "According to the World Economic Forum there are approximately 7,000 known living languages. One-third of these languages are African and most of the world speaks one of 20 languages. Two-fifths of the world’s languages are positioned to die out.\nNot all endangered languages are at equal risk of dying out. Here is UNESCO’s classification system which shows how vulnerable a language is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable\nMost children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home).\n\n\nDefinitely Endangered\nChildren no longer learn the language as a ‘mother tongue’ in the home.\n\n\nSeverely Endangered\nLanguage is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves.\n\n\nCritically Endangered\nThe youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently.\n\n\nExtinct\nThere are no speakers left."
